          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p class="opening-paragraph">Today we are practicing html postioning
            elements. We will learn how to move content to where we want it.
            This will improve the visual layout of a page.
          </p>
          <p>In order to practice this new skill we will need a lot of
            paragraphs of text. The more text that we have, the more layout we
            can practice.</p>
            <p>The goal here is to fill an entire screen with this text. I could
            use some ipsum, but it's funner to rant. Logherria is the absolute
          best.</p>
          <p>There's no way I'm going to fill a whole page though. Maybe we can
          make the text really big. Or use double-spacing. It's like that time
          in 7th grade when I had to write a 10 page paper. Throw a few
          illustrations in, and use some fancy typesetting... Boom, you're done
          in time to watch Captain Planet.</p>
        </section>
        <aside class="rant">
          <h3>We're ranting now</h3>
          <p>I'd like to say, while we're here, that writing HTML is even less
          fun than writing Markdown. It's not intolerable, but it really doesn't
        seem like humans are supposed to do it this way. I've used dreamweaver
      before, but that was even worse. The results <i>look</i> good, but the
      output is incredibly hard to deal with. Granted, this was while Bush (jr)
    was still president, but I doubt if a WYSIWIG tool can really produce
    quality output without compromising on control over the source.</p>
    <p>I think RST might be the answer to my prayers. Is it cheating if I use
    RST?</p>

        <aside class="questions">
          I've got questions!
          <ul>
            <li>I'm super bored of copy-pasting my &lt;nav&gt; block between
            all of my documents. Can I be more strategic? Will &lt;link&gt;
            help?</li>
            <li>Let's pretend that I've got <code>&lt;span class="turtle"&gt;
            </code> and <code>&lt;span class="pet"&gt;</code>. Can I write some
              css that makes all of my turtles be pets? Or do I need to
              use <code>&lt;span class="turtle pet"&gt;</code> every time?
            </li>
            <li>I'm pretty sure I understand the difference between
              <code>em</code> and <code>rem</code>. The former is relative to
            the current font, and the latter is relative to the "root"
            (unaltered, default size) font. But <i>when</i> should I use one or
            the other?</li>
            <li>If I've got <code>&lt;aside class="potato"&gt;&lt;p&gt;...
              &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;</code>,
            the class is only applied to <code>aside</code> and isn't
          applied to <code>p</code>. Is there any way that I don't have to tag
          all of my elements with the class, and instead have them inherit from
          their parent?</li>
          </ul>
